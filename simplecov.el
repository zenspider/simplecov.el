;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the ability to highlight untested code
;; according to simplecov by using its JSON serialized data.

;; See function `simplecov-show-coverage'.

;; Currently, you must manually run your tests with singlecov
;; activated.

;; If you're doing lots of coverage work, you might want to define
;; keybindings such as:
;;
;;   (define-key enh-ruby-mode-map (kbd "C-c r") 'simplecov-show-coverage)
;;   (define-key enh-ruby-mode-map (kbd "C-c R") 'simplecov-clear)

;;; History:

;; 2.0 2022-10-17 Overhaul into singlecov.el.
;; 1.3 2018-06-19 Added better overlay processing now that rcov is dead.
;; 1.2 2009-10-21 Added customizable overlay background color.
;; 1.1 2008-12-01 Added find-project-dir to fix path generation issues.
;; 1.0 2008-01-14 Birfday.
